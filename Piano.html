	<center><p class="cintros" id="ctxt4" onmouseover="read4()">The piano is an acoustic, keyboard, stringed percussion instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.</p></center>

			<p class="cintros" id="ctxt5" onmouseover="read5()">The invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments. Cristofori was an expert harpsichord maker, his knowledge of keyboard mechanisms and actions helped him to develop the first pianos. We don't know when exactly the first piano was built, but it exist by the year 1700.<br>
			The word "piano" is a shortened form of <span>pianoforte</span>, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument,the Italian musical terms <span>piano</span> and <span>forte</span> indicate "soft" and "loud" respectively.</p>

			<td class="cintros" id="ctxt6" onmouseover="read6()">In grand pianos the frame and strings are horizontal, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. The action lies beneath the strings, and uses gravity as its means of return to a state of rest. Grand pianos range in length from approximately 1.5 meters (4 ft 11 in) to 3 meters (9 ft 10 in).</td>

The mechanical action structure of the upright piano was invented in London, England in 1826 by Robert Wornum, and upright models became the most popular model.</th>

				electric pianos(1929) from the late 1920s used metal strings with a magnetic pickup, an amplifier and a loudspeaker.<br>
				Electronic pianos(1970) are non-acoustic; they do not have strings, tines or hammers, but are a type of synthesizer that simulates or imitates piano sounds using oscillators and filters that synthesize the sound of an acoustic piano.<br>
				Digital pianos(1980) are also non-acoustic and do not have strings or hammers. They use digital sampling technology to reproduce the acoustic sound of each piano note accurately.
