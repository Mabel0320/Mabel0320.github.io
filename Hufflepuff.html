        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.</p>

        <h2>Founder: <span>Helga Hufflepuff</span></h2>
        <p>Helga Hufflepuff (fl. c. 993) was a Welsh[2] witch and was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, although she did want them to be loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remained at Hogwarts by at least the 1980s.</p>
